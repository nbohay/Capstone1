My first Capstone Project completed Spring 2016. This was a web application that allowed a 
user to take a survey of how they felt each day.The DBT diary card is a daily diary used for 
dialectical behavior therapy. Usually this is one overwelming paper form filled out each day 
(if possible) that assists the psychologist in therapy and assists in points of discussion.
